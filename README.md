# mini-game-using-GitHub-Copilot-Python
The repo has code to develop the classic rock, paper, scissors minigame, with the help of GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot.


The rock, paper, scissors game is a hand game in which each player chooses one of the three tools. From a programming point of view, this challenge is a nice exercise to practice conditional decisions, iterations, and the use of Python modules.

The winner of the game is based in three simple rules:

Rock beats scissors.
Scissors beat paper.
Paper beats rock.


This project will demonstrate my ability to:

Use GitHub Codespaces as a development environment.
Use GitHub Copilot as an assistant.
Develop input and output routines in a Python console application.
